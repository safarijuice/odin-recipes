        <h2>Ube Brownie</h2>
        <p>These ube brownies are perfectly chewy and fudgy, with a vibrant purple color and delicious flavor thanks to ube halaya jam and extract! And just like your favorite chocolate brownie recipes, these ube brownies have a paper thin sugar top that crinkles when sliced.</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup (1 stick or 4 ounces or 113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>4 ounces (113 grams) white chocolate, finely chopped into ¼- and ½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>½ cup (4 ounces or 113 grams) ube halaya jam</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ube extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (7 ounces or 198 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup tightly packed (1.75 ounces or 50 grams) light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups (6.75 ounces or 191 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the oven and baking pan.</strong> Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray an 8-inch square pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on each of the pan's sides. Spray the parchment paper, too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Melt the butter and white chocolate for the batter.</strong> Place the butter and white chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water (be sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water).</p>
            <p>Cook over medium heat, using a heatproof rubber spatula to stir the mixture and scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the chocolate and butter have melted and combined, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan or bowl from heat and set on a wire rack to let the chocolate mixture cool slightly while you prep the other ingredients.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Whisk the ube jam, egg, and extract, then whisk in the sugars and chocolate mixture.</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the ube jam, egg, and extract until combined. Whisk the sugars in one at a time, then slowly pour in the chocolate mixture, whisking continuously while doing so until completely combined.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Mix in the dry ingredients.</strong> Once the chocolate mixture is combined, use the rubber spatula to scrape down the whisk and the bottom and sides of the bowl. Sprinkle the flour and salt over the batter all at once and use a rubber spatula to mix by hand until just combined.</li>
            <li><p><strong>Assemble the brownies.</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly across the pan and smooth the top.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Bake the brownies.</strong> Bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out with a few crumbs attached. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Serve and store.</strong> Run a butter knife or the offset spatula along the edges of the pan and use the overhanging parchment as handles to lift the brownies out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice into 2-inch squares and serve.</p>
            <p>The brownies can be stored in an airtight container or zip-top bag at room temperature for up to 3 days.</p></li>
