        <p>Make this easy Iced Matcha Latte just like your favorite coffee shop. Matcha is mixed together with cold milk, served over ice.</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons matcha powder</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons hot water</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Milk of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a measuring cup or bowl, add the matcha powder. 
                Pour in the 1 to 2 tablespoons of hot water and whisk until the matcha has fully incorporated into the water. 
                This should create almost a bit of a paste.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in the remaining 1 cup of water and mix. Transfer to the fridge or freezer to chill for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill two glasses full of ice and add your milk of choice so the glass is about 3/4 of the way full. 
                If you like, this is a great time to add any simple syrup. Lastly, pour in the chilled matcha and stir.</li>
        </ol>
